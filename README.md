# 🚀 PumpFun Sniper Bot v1

A real-time **Solana transaction sniper bot** that listens to the blockchain for token creation events (specifically for `pump.fun` tokens) and logs relevant transaction details like creator and token account information. Perfect for tracking new token launches and reacting quickly to opportunities! 🏃‍♂️💨

---

## 📝 Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Listens for token creation transactions on the Solana network.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Uses `wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com` for fast and reliable data streaming.
- **Transaction Filtering**: Filters transactions based on specific logs related to `pump.fun` tokens.
- **Ping Mechanism**: Keeps the WebSocket connection alive with regular pings.
- **Detailed Logs**: Provides insights into the creator and token account addresses when a new token is detected.

---

## ⚡ How It Works
1. **WebSocket Connection**: The bot connects to a Solana WebSocket endpoint to listen for incoming transactions.
2. **Transaction Subscription**: Subscribes to transactions involving a specific program ID (`pump.fun` token program).
3. **Event Detection**: When a transaction is detected, the bot checks if the logs contain the specific keyword `InitializeMint2` (token creation event).
4. **Details Extraction**: Extracts the transaction signature, creator, and token account details.
5. **Logging**: The bot outputs the relevant information in the console for easy tracking.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- TypeScript
- Solana CLI (for debugging and testing, optional)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pumpfun-sniper-bot.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd pumpfun-sniper-bot
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

---

## 🖥️ Usage

Once the bot is running, it will start listening for relevant transactions on the Solana network. When a `pump.fun` token is detected, it will log the transaction details to the console:

```
New pump.fun token!
Tx: [Signature]
Creator: [Creator Account]
Token: [Token Account]
```

## 🔧 Configuration

You can modify the WebSocket URL and the program ID in the `src/index.ts` file if you want to use a different Solana endpoint or monitor other programs.
